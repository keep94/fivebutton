fivebutton
==========

fivebutton is a program that prints all 936 possible combinations of the classic five button lock. On a five button lock, each key can be pressed only once, but the order in which keys are pressed matter. Moreover, two keys can be pressed simultaneously which is different than pressing them separately.

This program prints the shorter combination sequences first. Remember, pressing no keys at all is a valid combination. That is combination 1.
